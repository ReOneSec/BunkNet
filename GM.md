### üí° Why BunkNet? Solving the Web3 Learning Trilemma

An aspiring developer today faces a difficult choice between platforms that are either too expensive, too isolated, or too unstable. BunkNet is architected to provide a solution that offers the best of all worlds.

| Feature                      | **Public Testnets (e.g., Sepolia)** | **Local Chains (e.g., Hardhat)** | **‚úÖ BunkNet (The Solution)** |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost** | ‚ùå **Costly/Inconvenient:** Requires real ETH for bridging or unreliable faucets. | ‚úÖ **Free:** No real funds needed.                                  | ‚úÖ **Truly Free & Accessible:** No bridging required. Our high-throughput faucet is reliable and easy to use.           |
| **Realism & Collaboration** | ‚úÖ **Realistic:** A shared, persistent state for collaborative building. | ‚ùå **Isolated:** Runs only on your machine. Cannot collaborate with others. | ‚úÖ **Shared & Realistic:** A persistent, public state where you can build and interact with dApps from other learners. |
| **Stability & User Experience** | ‚ùå **Unstable:** Prone to reorganizations, spam, and deprecation. | ‚úÖ **Stable:** Fully controlled by you.                           | ‚úÖ **Highly Stable:** Professionally managed PoA network with predictable uptime and performance, optimized for learning. |
| **Focus** | ‚ùå **Speculative:** Often treated as a "pre-mainnet," attracting bots and airdrop hunters. | ‚úÖ **Focused:** Purely for development.                             | ‚úÖ **Purely Educational:** Our `$BUNK` token has zero monetary value, ensuring the entire ecosystem remains focused on building skills. |

### üåç The BunkNet Ecosystem: A Deep Dive
BunkNet provides a complete suite of integrated tools designed for a seamless, end-to-end learning journey.

| Component                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **‚õìÔ∏è BunkChain** | A high-speed, EVM-compatible blockchain running a stable Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus. It's built for instant feedback, a crucial element for effective learning and debugging.                     |
| **üîé BunkScan Explorer** | A didactic block explorer that translates raw blockchain data into human-readable insights. It decodes transaction data, explains gas fees, and visualizes contract interactions to demystify Web3. |
| **üí∞ The `$BUNK` Token** | The native utility token of the BunkChain, obtainable for free from our faucet. Its **zero-value** design is a core feature, ensuring a purely educational, speculation-free environment.             |
| **üíª Wallets (CLI & Bot)** | We offer a powerful **CLI Wallet** for developers and a user-friendly **Telegram Bot** (`BunkPay_Bot`) for beginners, ensuring everyone can access and interact with the BunkNet ecosystem easily.     |
| **üíß The Faucet** | A simple, reliable web service that dispenses free `$BUNK` tokens. This ensures any developer can start building immediately, removing all financial friction from the learning process.                  |

### üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
Our infrastructure is designed for reliability and clarity. User interactions flow from the wallet clients to our backend services, which are kept running 24/7 by a process manager.

üöÄ Getting Started: Your First 5 Minutes
Get the BunkNet CLI Wallet running on your local machine and start building.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
 * Git installed on your system.
 * Python 3.8+ and pip installed.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the project:
git clone [https://github.com/ReOneSec/BunkNet.git](https://github.com/ReOneSec/BunkNet.git)
cd BunkNet

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment & Install Dependencies
Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to avoid conflicts.
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

> Note: The requirements.txt file contains all necessary packages, including requests, mnemonic, ecdsa, and pycryptodome.
> 
4Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the Wallet!
You're all set. Run the interactive application:
python3 wallet.py

> IMPORTANT: On your first run, select option 1 to create a new wallet. Immediately write down your 12-word seed phrase on paper and store it in a secure, offline location. This is your master key!
