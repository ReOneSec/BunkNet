## ‚ú® Core Features

* **üéì Pedagogical by Design:** Every tool, from the explorer to the wallet, is built to be a learning experience.
* **‚õìÔ∏è EVM-Compatible Blockchain:** Write smart contracts in Solidity and use familiar tools like Hardhat, Truffle, and Remix. The skills you learn are directly transferable.
* **üí∞ Zero-Cost, Zero-Risk:** Our native `$BUNK` token has no monetary value and is free from the faucet. This eliminates financial barriers and speculative noise.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Integrated Toolchain:** A complete ecosystem with a testnet, block explorer, wallets, and faucet that work together seamlessly.
* **ü§ù Open Source & Community-Driven:** BunkNet is a public utility built for the community, by the community. All code is open source under the MIT license.

## üèÅ Getting Started: Running the CLI Wallet Locally

Get the most powerful tool in the BunkNet ecosystem, the CLI Wallet, running on your local machine in just a few steps.

### **1. Prerequisites**

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.

### **2. Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal and clone the official BunkNet repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ReOneSec/BunkNet.git](https://github.com/ReOneSec/BunkNet.git)

3. Navigate to the Directory
cd BunkNet

4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using pip. It's recommended to do this in a virtual environment.
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

> 
5. Run the Wallet!
You are all set! Launch the interactive wallet application:
python3 wallet.py

You will be greeted by the BunkNet Wallet menu. Your first step should be to select option 1 to create a new wallet. Remember to write down your seed phrase and keep it safe!
